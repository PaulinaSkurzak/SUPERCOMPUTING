# Assignment 1 Essay

When I saw Supercomputing for Science came out as a new elective, I was intrigued.
Through my research, coursework, and projects, I was able to build models and run analyses successfully, but often only on small datasets or on my personal computer.
High-performance computing makes it possible to run larger experiments and produce results that are repeatable.
Learning high-performance computing will help me build the practical skills needed for industry roles that involve working with large datasets and complex computational systems.

As I learned more about the course, I realized that high-performance computing is not only about speed, but also about how computational work is designed and managed. Being able to run larger experiments requires careful planning, clear organization, and an understanding of how computing resources are used. I am especially interested in learning how these skills apply to real research and industry settings, where code often needs to be reused, shared, and maintained over time. 
Developing these habits early will help me become a more careful and responsible programmer.

My main goal for this course is to learn how to structure and run computational projects in a clear, organized, and reproducible way.
I also want to become more comfortable using the command line. 
Specifically, I hope to improve my ability to organize projects clearly, learn more about best practices for reproducible research, become more confident using the tools in this course, and understand how performance and efficiency affect computational work. 
These skills are important both in academics and industry work. 
Additionally, I see this course as a basic foundation to future more advanced computational projects.

My plan for learning this semester is to focus on consistency and practice. 
I also plan to actively review my own work throughout the semester by revisiting earlier assignments and improving them as my understanding grows. 
Rather than viewing assignments as finished once submitted, I want to treat them as part of an ongoing learning process. 
This approach will help reinforce concepts and encourage me to think critically about my workflow, documentation, and organization choices.
I think that for a course such as this one, consistency triumphs being exceptionally great at one single thing. 
This is especially true when it comes to creating reproducible code. 
I plan to learn from my errors when learning new tools and concepts as well as understand why things are done in the way that they are. 
Understanding and consistency will be prioritized over speed and I will take mistakes as windows of opportunity to solidify understanding.  

The folder structure I created for Assignment 1 separates data, code, and outputs. 
This makes the project easier to understand and helps ensure that results can be reproduced. 
It is clear which files are inputs, which files run the analysis, and which files are generated as outputs.
Keeping raw data separate from code helps prevent accidental changes and makes it possible to rerun the analysis from the original data. 
Organizing scripts and outputs clearly also makes the project easier to follow for others or for my future self. 
Overall, this structure supports good research habits and reduces confusion as projects become more complex.

Documented code is important because code is a record of how computation work is done. 
Without it, it is difficult to understand why it was created in the way that it was or how results were produced.  

I have a background in data science and mathematics. 
While I am comfortable working with models and data, I want to improve my understanding of the computational systems behind them. 

This course is important to me because it helps connect between writing code and doing reliable computational research. 
I have experience in research using global health data as a Research Fellow for the Schroeder Center for Public Health, and I believe this course will also aid in my current and future research projects.
I hope to use the skills I learn this semester in future coursework, research projects, and professional work that involves large-scale or complex data analysis.
